The additional server will enable us to have redundancy as well as reduce congestion due to the addition of a load balancer.
This will overall improve the performance of the website.
The load balancer will use the round robin distribution algorithm. This algorithm works by assigning requests to the servers
depending on the number of the request, oddly number requests go to server 1 and evenly numbered requests go to server 2.
The load balancer enables an Active-Active setup, this is to reduce the congestion and lessen the load of the first server.
In an active-active setup both servers will work at the same time while in a passive-passive set up one of the servers will be on standby
for redundancy.
The Primary-Replica cluster usually gets updated everytime the Master database gets updated. Data from the master gets replicated to the slave.
The replica node relies on data from the primary node. This is because replication is event-driven.

The SPOF are:
  - the connection of the client to the internet
  - the connection of the web servers to the internet
  - malfunction in the load balancer

The server set up has no firewalls and does not use HTTPS making it vulnerable to attacks.
There is also no monitoring so it would be difficult to predict peak hours, to identify when congestion occurs and why the congestion occurs as well
as enable faster recovery from congestion.
