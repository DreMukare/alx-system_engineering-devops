The firewalls are to add protection to the load balancer and the two servers.
There is also addition of HTTPS for the encryption of the requests and the response to the requests.
The traffic is served over HTTPS because it has added security.
Monitoring enables the idenfitication of points of failure in the setup, congestion, it also enables better planning of updates
to the set up due to the identification of peak hours.
The server monitor runs in a container alongside any number of other containers on a host.
From there it can collect metrics from its neighboring containers and from the host itself.
To monitor the web sever Queries Per Second, a job that runs a `SHOW STATUS` query could be run at certain intervals.

Terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue because in the chance that one gained unauthorized access past the load balancer,
they would be able to eavesdrop on the requests and responses.
If this MySQL server were to fail, all the data changes from the writes would be lost.
Servers with the same components might be a problem because there is still the possibility for both of them being overwhelmed by congestion.
