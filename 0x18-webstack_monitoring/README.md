# 0x18. Webstack monitoring

Monitoring is important because it ensures that your systems are running as they should.
In this project, I set up datadog to monitor a digital ocean droplet.

There are two categories of monitoring:
- Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
- Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)
